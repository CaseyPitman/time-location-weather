Weather With Galactus

JavaScript & jQuery

This was my first foray into utilizing an API (OpenWeather). It gives the current time and weather conditions in my hometown (location-based conditions coming soon). The display felt bland, so I decided I needed a meterologist to deliver the weather conditions. Who better than a millenia old planet devouring cosmic entity whose vast hunger can never be sated?
